<p>Born in 1996, and it's all been downhill since there. My name is Ryan Hathaway (see above), and I was born in Portland, Oregon, but I have lived in Colorado for most of my life. Currently I live in Cleveland, Ohio for some reason. As far as jobs go, I travel for work (delivery driver at Jimmy John's). 6'4" if that matters.</p>
